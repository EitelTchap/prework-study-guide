# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is to build my Bootcamp prework study guide webpage. I built this project to help me keep up with the course by taking as much notes as I can througout the bootcamp.

By taking notes on all the topics that will be covered, I will create for myself a repository of quick info to return to which will help prevent the disaster called 'I can't remember!'.

So far in the prework study guide I have:
- Learnt to start thinking like a developer using methods to connect with the Developer Community and how to adopt a growth mindset.
- Learnt to practice Computational Thinking and examine an agile software environment like Github.
- Downloaded and set up all the necessary Applications I will need througout the bootcamp.
- Learnt how to code HTML, CSS, Javascript and how to use the command line.
- Gained awareness of the GitHub Workflow and version control, and how to use it using the git add commit pull push commands.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to write notes on what I learn during the Front End Web Development Bootcamp.Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

Each section contains notes about topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. By opening the DevTools console (on a website, right click, select 'inspect') we can see the layout of our code and the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
